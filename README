= Blurb
Log files are big boring tangles of spaghetti that are about as much fun to
review in their raw format as it is to go to the dentist. Yet, not reviewing
your logs is one sure-fire way to be negligent, especially when you're a System
Administrator. What is needed is a log distiller - something that will make
sense out of your logs and give a succinct report on them.

Enter clog. Clog distills logs with the help of agents which are chunks of ruby
code. A chain of agents is called for each line of the log file. At the end,
the agents are asked to report on their findings. Agents are simple to write
and as a result clog is easy to customize and extend. 

Clog is designed to be up and running in no time flat. The configuration file
specifies which logs to distill, and the chain of agents to use for each
pattern of log files. See the example annotated configuration file.

If you write an agent for the logs generated by a common piece of software,
send it along (preferably as a darcs patch bundle) and I will probably include
it.  While you are free to do literally anything with your homegrown agents,
the philosophy of the distributed agents is to say as little as possible in the
report, to not leave out anything important, and to not consume anything that
is not understood so that anomalous readings can be reported by the Fallback
agent.

= Installation
  make test | less -S
  make install

The install make target does not set up a cron job. See examples/crontab for a
sample crontab.
